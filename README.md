# Zepto - 10 Min Grocery Delivery Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Zeptoâ€™s inventory dataset to uncover meaningful insights about products, pricing, discounts, stock availability, and revenue contribution.
The analysis highlights trends such as best-value products, high-MRP items that are out of stock, category-wise revenue, discount patterns, price efficiency per gram, and inventory weight distribution.
