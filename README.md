## Key Insights 
 * Top  Best-Value Products (Highest Discount %)
    - The top products offering the highest discounts provide the best value for customers. These items, such as `Dukes Waffy Orange Wafers`,`Ceres Foods Laal Maas Instant Liquid Masala`,
   `Chef's Basket Durum Wheat Elbow Pasta` and `Ceres Foods Nalli Nihari Instant Liquid Masala`, have discounts ranging from `51%` to `45%`, making them highly attractive for buyers looking for savings.

 * Products with High MRP but Out of Stock
   - Several premium products with high MRP, including `Patanjali Cow's Ghee`, `MamyPoko Pants Standard Diapers, Extra Large (12 - 17 kg)`, and `Aashirvaad Atta With Mutigrains`, are currently         out of stock. These high-value items represent potential lost revenue, highlighting the need for better inventory planning for high-demand, high-priced products.
  
 * Revenue per Category:
      - Total revenue across all products is ₹122M, but it is not evenly distributed. Certain categories, like Beverages and Snacks, contribute the most to sales, generating ₹35M and ₹28M respectively, while smaller categories like Stationery and Household contribute relatively little. Understanding these patterns helps in focusing marketing and inventory efforts on the top-performing categories.
